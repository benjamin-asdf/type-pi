* Dev

#+begin_src
  bb tasks
#+end_src

- =bb serve local= for a dev http server.

- Start clj, then eval [[file:src/dev/repl.clj][file]] src/dev/repl.clj and run =go=.
- Connect to localhost 7014 with a cljs repl, if desired.

- Occasionally, you have to make another change to trigger a correct update + css.

** Tech

Makes heavy use of @thheller Thomas Heller stuff.

This does not have a server at the moment. This is static website.

- shadow-cljs to build clojurescript
- reagent
- shadow css to build css
- https://github.com/thheller/shadow-css

- If you use a server, you could use shadow-graft for the full theller stack.
