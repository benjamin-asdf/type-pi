* This is deployed:

https://benjamin-asdf.github.io/type-pi/

* Dev

#+begin_src
  bb tasks
#+end_src


- =bb serve local= for a dev http server.

- Start clj, then eval [[file:src/dev/repl.clj][file]] src/dev/repl.clj and run =go=.

** Growth area:

- update the css and the js build consistently,
- currently I need to either reload or trigger another build with a file change
